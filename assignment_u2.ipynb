            "2. **Miners:** Specialized nodes that verify and add new transactions to the blockchain.\n",

            "1. A user initiates a transaction by sending a request to the network.\n",
            "2. The transaction is broadcast to the network, where it's verified by nodes using complex mathematical equations (hash functions).\n",
            "3. Miners collect a group of unconfirmed transactions (called a block) and compete to solve a mathematical puzzle.\n",
            "4. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.\n",
            "5. Each block is linked to the previous block through a unique identifier (hash) creating a chain of blocks (hence, blockchain).\n",
